ros-humble-swri-transform-util (0.1.3-1jammy) jammy; urgency=high

  * Fixes initialize_origin.py diagnostic reporting a warning that the
    origin is not automatic when it is.
  * Adds transform publisher to initialize_origin.py that publishes an
    identity transform from the local_xy_frame to an anonymous unused
    frame.  In doing so, the local_xy_frame will show up
    in the /tf tree without any additional nodes running so that
    TransformManager can properly transform between /wgs84 and /map.
    This change should not interfere with any existing systems.
  * Expands some of the TransformManager warnings to be more
    informative.  This is to reduce the impact of common problems that we
    run into when setting up a new environment by making it easier to
    distinguish the exact nature of the error, as well as provide
    suggestions when appropriate.
    In particular, this fixes the misleading
    "No transfomer from /wgs84 to /map" error and upgrades a warning
    about null pointers to an error.

  * Removes dependency on gps_common
    The gps_common package was removed in ROS Jade, so a different message
    type is needed for the local XY origin message. (Issue #246 <https://github.com/swri-robotics/marti_common/issues/246>).
    This replaces the gps_common/GPSFix message with a
    geometry_msgs/PoseStamped message. The latitude is stored in
    pose.position.y, the longitude is stored in pose.position.x, and the
    altitude is stored in pose.position.z. As before, the local xy frame is
    fixed in rotation such that the Z axis points away from the center of
    the Earth and the Y axis points north. However, the choice of
    geometry_msgs/PoseStamped allows for headings to be added in the future.
  * Refactors initialize origin and fixes a bug.

  * Accounts for non-zero reference angles when calculating orientations to and from WGS84.
  * Publishes origin with east orientation (0 yaw) by default.
  * Supports arbitrary local_xy reference angles.
    * The reference heading is renamed to reference angle.
    * It's not recommended to set a non-zero reference angle.
    * Adds a parameter to ignore the reference heading for backwards compatibility.
  * Fixes backwards compatibility issue with swri_yaml_cpp call.
